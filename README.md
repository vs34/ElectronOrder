# ElectronOrder SoC
- inspired by the Apple M1 
design a single System-on-Chip (SoC) that integrates multiple components similar to the M1
## Project Goals
### CORE (RISC V)
- ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) variant RV32I
#### CPU Components 
- Instruction Fetch Unit (IFU)
- Instruction Decode Unit (IDU)
- Execution Units
- Register File
- Control Logic
- Pipeline Stages
