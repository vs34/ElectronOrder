## Hello Friend 
This is a hard project for me with my current plans for this project, 
that way i am creating you to put my thoughts here

lets start
### CPU/Fetcher
wrote **Instruction Fetch Unit (IFU)** ez read from a file
* _ASSUMPTION_ the fetch unit will fetch the instruction after every clock cycle
  irrsepect to the current state of pipeline memory.
  to solve this i could impliment a signal from pipeline which tell when to fetch next instruction

### CPU/Decoder
 **Instruction Decode Unit (IDU)** moderate requare reading (RISCV ISA)
