### Project Outline: ElectronOrder SoC

#### Overview

The ElectronOrder SoC is a comprehensive project to design a
System-on-Chip (SoC) inspired by the Apple M1.
This SoC integrates a core CPU based on the RISC-V architecture with multiple
components, mimicking the functionality of a modern, high-performance SoC.

#### Project Goals

1. **Core CPU Design (RISC-V RV32I)**
2. **Integration of Various Components Similar to Apple M1**
3. **Creating a Complete SoC Environment**

### 1. Core CPU Design

The CPU design will be based on the RISC-V RV32I (32-bit Integer)
Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).

#### CPU Components

1. **Instruction Fetch Unit (IFU)**

   - Fetches instructions from memory.
   - Handles program counter (PC) management and branch prediction.

2. **Instruction Decode Unit (IDU)**

   - Decodes the fetched instructions.
   - Determines the operation and operands.
   - Sends control signals to other parts of the CPU.

3. **Register File**

   - Set of registers for quick data storage and retrieval.
   - Typically consists of 32 registers for ~~RV32I~~ RV30I.
     **CHANGE IN PLAN Repurposeing Some Register - 2 reg**
   - 4bit for input
   - 8bit for sound
   - 52 bit for display (4 == 52/13) the cpu could change at most 4 pixel per cycle of clock
     - 10 bit address of pixel to change color (2^10 = 1080 pixel 32 X 32)
     - 3 bit color to change display (2^3 = 8 shade)

4. **Execution Units**

   - **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations.
   - **Branch Unit**: Handles branch instructions.
   - **Load/Store Unit**: Manages memory access instructions.

5. **Control Logic**

   - Manages the operation of the CPU based on decoded instructions.
   - Generates control signals for other components.

6. **Pipeline Stages**
   - **Fetch**: Retrieves the instruction from memory.
   - **Decode**: Decodes the instruction and reads registers.
     - **Memory Access**: Reads data from memory. (inside Dcoder)
   - **Execute**: Executes the instruction (ALU operations, branches).
     - **Write Back**: Writes the result back to the register file. (no module direct in pipeline)

### 2. Integration of Various Components

To create an SoC similar to the Apple M1, additional components need to be integrated:

1. **Memory (RAM and ROM)**

   - RAM: For dynamic data storage.
   - ROM: For bootloader and firmware.

2. **I/O Controllers**

   - Handles input and output operations.
   - Interfaces like UART, GPIO, SPI, I2C.

3. **Cache Memory**

   - L1 Cache: Small, fast memory for frequently accessed data.
   - L2 Cache: Larger than L1, stores less frequently accessed data.

4. **GPU (Optional)**

   - For handling graphics operations.
   - Can be a simple co-processor for initial implementation.

5. **Security Modules**

   - Encryption and decryption units.
